Finite Element Discretization of a Reduced-Order Model for Perfusion and Pressure in Liver Vasculature

We present a finite element discretization of a mixed-dimensional (3D-1D) model for blood flow and perfusion in the hepatic vasculature. Flow within the embedded 1D vessel network is formulated using a topological model reduction on a 3D-3D coupled vessel problem performed by Laurino and Zunino (2019). A weighted averaging operator enforces continuity of pressure and flux at the vessel-tissue interface. We imposed Robin boundary conditions on specific endpoints of the 1D network to account for the influence of far-field pressure sources such as the hepatic artery, with Neumann conditions applied elsewhere. The resulting time-dependent system is discretized using the backward Euler method and implemented within the FEniCS finite element framework. We validated and adjusted model parameters under realistic physiological conditions using real extracted meshes of porcine liver vasculature. Furthermore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of variations in key parameters, including Darcy conductivity and tissue perfusion coefficients.
